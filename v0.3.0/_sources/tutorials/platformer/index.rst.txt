This tutorial teaches the fundamentals of working with rubato.
By the end of this process, you should have the tools you need to make your own games and simulations!

This tutorial is split up into the following steps. To follow along, you will need these

Please note that this is not a comprehensive overview of every feature rubato has to offer. A variety of additional
tutorials are planned for the topics that were not covered here. If you would like to learn more about the advanced
features rubato has, there are also tutorials on custom components, bundling to an executable with PyInstaller, and more.

At the end of each step, we've included the source code for the main file. You can also find the
completed game source `here <https://github.com/rubatopy/rubato/blob/main/demo/platformer.py>`_.
