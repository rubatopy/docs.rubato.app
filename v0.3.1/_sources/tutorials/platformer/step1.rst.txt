Step 1 - Basic Structure
##########################

Before we can design our game, we need to do a few things to set rubato up.

First, follow the :doc:`setup guide <../../intro>`, naming your file ``main.py``.

Then, download and extract these
`files <https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rubatopy/rubato/main/demo/files/files.zip>`_
into the same directory as your ``main.py`` file (so you have ``main.py`` and the ``files`` folder in the same directory.)

At this point, your ``main.py`` file should look like this:

.. code-block:: python

    import rubato as rb

    rb.init()

    rb.begin()

Running ``main.py`` using ``python main.py`` should result in a window similar to this appearing:

.. image:: /_static/tutorials_static/platformer/step1/1.png
    :width: 25%
    :align: center

:code:`rb.init()` is the initializer function for the library.
It will ensure that rubato can communicate with the computer hardware and
set up a window for you.

:code:`rb.begin()` actually runs the game loop. The loop will
handle all of the rendering, player logic, etc. Without calling it, nothing happens.

To customize your game window, you can pass in a few parameters. For now, let's:
    * Give our window a name
    * Change its resolution

Replace the previous :code:`rb.init()` call with this:

.. code-block:: python

    # initialize a new game
    rb.init(
        name="Platformer Demo",  # Set a name
        res=rb.Vector(1920, 1080),  # Set the window resolution (pixel length and height).
            # note that since we didn't also specify a window size,
            # the window will be automatically resized to half of the resolution.
    )


Here we're introducing a new class: :func:`rb.Vector <rubato.utils.vector.Vector>`.

A rubato :func:`Vector <rubato.utils.vector.Vector>` is an object that contains two numbers, x and y.
A Vector can represent a point, dimensions, a mathematical vector, or anything else that has x and y
parameters. The :func:`Vector <rubato.utils.vector.Vector>` class comes loaded with
many useful transformation functions and also allows super intuitive math using operator overloading. We'll take a
deeper look at what that means in a bit.

At this point, running the game should look like this:

.. image:: /_static/tutorials_static/platformer/step1/2.png
    :width: 75%
    :align: center

Here is what your main.py should look like:

.. code-block:: python

    import rubato as rb

    # initialize a new game
    rb.init(
        name="Platformer Demo",  # Set a name
        res=rb.Vector(1920, 1080),  # Set the window resolution (pixel length and height).
            # note that since we didn't also specify a window size,
            # the window will be automatically resized to half of the resolution.
    )

    # begin the game
    rb.begin()


If you made it here, great! We're ready to build the platformer.
Next, we'll create a player and add him to the game.
