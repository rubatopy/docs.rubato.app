************
Installation
************
Installing rubato is simple. Just run the following in a terminal:

.. code-block:: console

    $ pip install rubato

.. note::
    | Python 3.10.x required
    | We recommend installing python direct from python.org if you do not already have it.

On Windows and Mac, the dll files that SDL needs come pre-bundled with rubato, so you should be ready to go.

.. dropdown:: On Linux **only**, you'll need to install them yourself:

    .. code-block:: console

        $ pip install pysdl2-dll

************
Setting Up
************
Once you've installed rubato, setting up a new project is easy.
To create a new blank project, simply create a new python file and type the following:

.. code-block:: python

    import rubato as rb

    rb.init()

:func:`rb.init() <rubato.init>` initializes rubato.
An optional dictionary argument passed into :func:`rb.init() <rubato.init>` can specify such things as window size, resolution, background color, and more.

.. note::

    Throughout our documentation, we assume that rubato is imported as ``rb``.

rubato documentation describes exactly what custom parameters you can specify when creating rubato objects or calling specific functions such as ``init()``.

.. warning::
    You should `only` interact with rubato (adding scenes, game objects, etc.) **AFTER** calling ``init()``.

Now that rubato is ready, add the following line of code to the end of the file:

.. code-block:: python

    rb.begin()

:func:`rb.begin() <rubato.begin>` is the function that starts the rubato engine.
Without it, rubato won't know to begin the engine cycle, and your game won't run.
It is recommended to call :func:`rb.begin() <rubato.begin>` at the bottom of your project file as in this example.

Now run your code in a terminal using ``python3 YOUR_FILENAME.py``. If you see a white square window, congrats!
You're officially up and running with rubato.

.. note::
    Code not working? It's possible something went wrong during the dependency installation process.
    Check your terminal log for errors and reinstall rubato and the SDL dlls if necessary.
